## Add your Bot ID to your Heroku app:

![Add the Bot ID environment variable](http://i.groupme.com/784x148.png.5790498a7acd46b289aca2be43e9c84e)

## Now go test your bot!

Go to GroupMe and type "/cool guy" in the group where your bot lives to see it in action.

![Test your Bot](http://i.groupme.com/821x587.png.7bcf55bed1c64acab83fa2c2ad0b0862)

# Make it your own<a name="pull"></a>

## Pull the code to your local machine

Within terminal, change directory to the location where you would like the files to live, then run this command:

    $ heroku git:clone -a YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE

And then change directory into the new folder

    $ cd YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE

## Configure your local BOT_ID environment variable

Open the file `.env` from your local files in your text editor of choice.
Find where it says "YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE" and replace it with the ID of your new bot.

If you don't know what your Bot ID is, please refer back to [this](#get-bot-id) section,
where it is explained how to retrieve it.

If your Bot ID is 12345678910, then:

    BOT_ID="YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE"

becomes:

    BOT_ID="12345678910"

## Start the server

To test your bot locally, open terminal and run the following command to start a local server.

    $ foreman start

Then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in a browser.

![Local bot](http://i.groupme.com/502x133.png.f06c630467954f5dab4c742dc67b71bf)

## All done! Go play around and make the bot your own.

##Troubleshooting
If you get errors make sure you have the following dependencies installed in the bot's directory:
* Foreman 
* Director
* cool-ascii-faces

Run: `npm ls --depth=0` to check what packages you have in your bot's directory.

If you're missing any use the following commands to install them:

1. `npm install foreman`
2. `npm install director`
3. `npm install cool-ascii-faces`

Sometimes you might need to use `nf start` instead of `foreman start`.

If you plan on hosting the bot locally you will also need to open port 5000 on your router as well as changing the URL to `http://Your_IP_Address:5000` within your bot settings on groupme.
